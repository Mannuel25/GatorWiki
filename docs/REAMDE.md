# docs/ README

This directory contains various documentation for the project.

## Guidelines

File-specific implementation details should be documented within the code as 
docstrings and comments. Implementations which depend on manual configurations
or external systems may be documented in this directory, particularly if the 
configuration is complex or relies on external sites (SSO).

High level descriptions of the GatorWiki project architecture are documented
in arch.md, including different pages, APIs, database models, and services
within the project and the interactions between them.

All other documentation, including diagrams or figures, can be stored here.
